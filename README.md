# Rust Docker setup for M1 Macs

Running Rust applications with Diesel on M1 Macs can be challenging due to missing necessary libraries. This repository offers a Docker solution to seamlessly run your Rust applications, ensuring compatibility and ease of setup.

## Prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your M1 Mac.
  
## Steps to Run:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t rust_docker .
   ```

   This command builds the Docker image and tags it as `rust_docker`.

2. **Configuration Changes**:

   Before running your application, make sure to adjust the connection URLs in your `config.yaml` file for the PostgreSQL and QDranT databases. Replace `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`. For example:

   ```yaml
   database_url: "postgres://dboperator:operatorpass123@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres"
   qdrant_url: "http://host.docker.internal:6333"
   ```

   This change allows the Docker container to connect to services running on your host machine.

3. **Run the Docker Container**:

   In the root directory of your Rust project, execute:

   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/root/backend_infra rust_docker
   ```

   This command:

   - Maps port `3000` of the container to port `3000` on your host machine.
   - Mounts your current directory (your Rust project) to `/root/backend_infra` in the Docker container. This ensures any changes you make to your local code will reflect in the container instantly.
   - Initiates the container with a Zsh shell, as configured in the Dockerfile.

4. **Inside the Docker Container**:

   Once inside the container's shell:

   - Navigate to `/root/backend_infra`.
   - Run your Rust application as you normally would on a local setup.

## Note:

- This setup uses Zsh for an enhanced shell experience, and the configuration has been copied into the container. Adjustments can be made by modifying the `.zshrc` file in this repository and rebuilding the Docker image.
  
- Always ensure that any services or databases running on your host are properly secured, especially when exposing ports or making connections.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
